    <h2>Welcome to Middle Ground!</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Middle Ground Is Open Again</h3>
        <p><em>al-Ḥamdulillāh</em> we&#8217;re excited to announce our <strong>return to normal operations as of <span style="color:#800000" class="has-inline-color">Friday, May 21st</span></strong>, in shā’ Allāh.</p>
        <p class="arabic">وَآتاكُم مِن كُلِّ ما سَأَلتُموهُ ۚ وَإِن تَعُدّوا نِعمَتَ اللَّهِ لا تُحصوها ۗ إِنَّ الإِنسانَ لَظَلومٌ كَفّارٌ</p>
        <blockquote><em>&#8220;He has given you everything you have asked Him for. If you tried to number Allāh&#8217;s  blessings, you could never count them. Man is indeed wrongdoing, ungrateful.&#8221;</em> — <strong>Qur&#8217;an 14: 34</strong></blockquote>

<p><strong>Middle Ground Muslim Center</strong> began as an idea; an <em>ideal</em>. We are a small group of concerned Muslims looking to create a new space that will serve as a place for the community to connect with God and with each other. We are located in Upland, California, in the heart of the Inland Empire. We hope <strong>Middle Ground’s</strong> intimate setting will provide you with a space to nurture and grow your Islam amongst friends.</p>



<p><strong>Our methodology is simple</strong>: <strong style="color: #800000">religious and spiritual development through hands-on tutelage and camaraderie</strong>. Everyone at <strong>Middle Ground</strong>, from the staff to the participants, are here to learn and grow. </p>



<p>As you experience <strong>Middle Ground</strong>&nbsp;please feel free to <a href="https://muslim.center/contact/">leave us feedback</a> so we may improve upon the services we offer. We look forward to serving you.</p>

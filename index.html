				imam and religious
				director at <a href="https://muslim.center">Middle Ground</a>. I started my path towards being an imam back in
				Detroit where I started my Islamic studies under the tutelage of <a
					href="https://www.alimprogram.org/dr-ali-sulaiman-ali.html">Dr. Ali Sulaiman Ali</a>. I subsequently spent a
				number of years studying the <em>Warsh</em> recitation of the Qur'an from a <em>hafidh</em> from Algeria.</p>
			<p>Years later I found myself in Philadelphia, America's premier city for indigenous Islam, where, under the
				support of such teachers as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anwar-muhaimin-587b8513/">Shaykh Anwar Muhaimin
					at Quba Masjid</a> and <a href="https://law.rutgers.edu/directory/view/az319">Adnan Zulficar</a>, I took the
				position of Muslim Chaplain at the University of Pennsylvania. From here I also developed the first Muslim
				chaplaincy program at Drexel University. Not long after, the <a href="https://ranchomasjid.org/">Islamic Center
					of Inland Empire</a> called, offering the position of Imam and Director. I left ICIE in 2015 to open <a
					href="https://muslim.center">Middle Ground</a>. You can read more about what Middle Ground is there but to say
				the least, it's been a life-changing experiece that's still unfoldilng.</p>
